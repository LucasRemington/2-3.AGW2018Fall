Gravity: Effect of grav on all objects now considerably decreased. Instead, player script has been changed to increase downward velocity. A script for all other objects has been created to mimic this, specifically meant for crates.

Pushing/Pulling: Similar to before. Objects no longer ever kinesmatic, instead drag starts out incredibly high, making them difficult to push by walking into them. Grabbing on to them to push or pull sets drag to a very small amount temporarily.

Throwing: Unchanged, unfortunately :/

Terminals and Dialogue: The Q key, or the X Button on an Xbox controller, is now required to initiate dialogue and still requires the player to be still and not occupied otherwise. Any of the three major buttons (jump, grab, and talk) can be used to skim through dialogue.

Corruption: Corruption now decays at half the rate the player would corrupt if they are standing in a non-corruptive area. Ie, the player will "heal" for 1% every 2 seconds.

UI: A sphere fills up to indicate "fast" corruption ticks. Corruption does not settle in until it fills up completely. For every ten points of "slow" corruption (gained when the fast completely ticks), a bar will fill up in a second indicator. 

Misc: The Escape key now quits the game. The R key will destroy the player and initiate the respawn sequence.
